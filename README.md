# All Roads Lead To PyKX

This repo contains all the files that give context to our [first post](first-post/AllRoadsLeadToPyKX.md) and its [technical coutnerpart](technical-post/) (LINK TECH POST ONCE ITS HTML IS GENERATED !!!!).

[PyKX 1.6](https://code.kx.com/pykx/1.6/getting-started/installing.html) needs to be installed in order to run the Python code and [pykx.q](https://code.kx.com/pykx/1.6/api/pykx_under_q.html) as well for running the q code. Of course, to run q code you need [q](https://code.kx.com/q/learn/install/) installed.

To obtain the source data files in CSV format, follow the posts' instructions and place them where the code needs them to be. If placed elsewhere, you will need to change the read paths on the source code.
