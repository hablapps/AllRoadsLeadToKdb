    "# All Roads Lead to Kdb: the technical counterpart\n",
    "\n",
    "This post serves as a follow-up to our prior article, [All Roads Lead to Kdb](https://www.habla.dev/blog/2023/07/31/all-roads-lead-to-pykx.html), where we introduced the utility of the PyKX library from the perspective of Emma Monad, the CTO of a large fictional company known as Mad Flow. In complement to this high-level perspective, the focus of this post is on Pythonist programmers who are eager to explore the technical intricacies that were left unexplained in the aforementioned article. Our fictional characters, Eloy, Jes칰s, and F칠lix, will assist us in comprehending both the objectives of Mad Flow's traffic improvement use case and the technical nuances of PyKX's role within it. In a manner similar to the outcomes presented in this [post](https://kx.com/blog/accelerating-python-workflows-using-pykx/) on the [KX developer blog](https://kx.com/resources/developer-blog/) by Morrison and Crone (which we highly recommend reading), we will observe a significant performance advantage of the resulting PyKX code compared to the initial Pandas implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of the post will be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [**The Use Case**](#t2): We will begin by explaining the traffic improvement use case itself, encompassing its objectives, data sources, and anticipated outcomes. This section will also include references to the necessary data sources required to execute all the code provided in this notebook.\n",
    "* [**PyKX migration**](#t3): Subsequently, we will demonstrate how to delegate resource-intensive processing to kdb+/q using PyKX, all while remaining within the Python environment! This Pythonic version powered by PyKX is likely the quickest route to start leveraging the capabilities of the kdb+/q environment.\n",
    "* [**pykx.q migration**](#t4): Lastly, we will delve into the process of transitioning the code to pure kdb+/q, while continuing to utilize PyKX to retain the Pythonic code you wish to preserve. This kdb+/q version enhanced by PyKX is presented for those interested in a more extensive adoption of kdb+/q.\n",

    "## Use Case<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"t2\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "With the aim of predicting traffic congestion in the presence of rain, Mad Flow dedicated significant effort to preparing and integrating weather and traffic data into an LSTM model. This endeavor aligned with other [studies](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/13/3749) that sought to forecast traffic patterns using LSTM models based on air pollution. In a manner akin to findings from studies conducted in cities such as [Manchester](https://pure.manchester.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/72721911/DEXA_Camera_8_pages.pdf), [Shenzhen](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8964560) and [Belgrade](https://www.safetylit.org/citations/index.php?fuseaction=citations.viewdetails&citationIds[]=citjournalarticle_716898_14), our results project a weekday traffic volume increase of 5-15% during peak hours in the presence of rain.\n",

While a direct measurement of this distance employing coordinates is feasible, we have opted for the utilization of the [Haversine distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula).

    "After gaining proficiency in the q language, the team progressively shifted towards utilizing `kx.q()` extensively, drawn by its brevity. Yet, this approach introduced a level of monotony due to the requirement of employing strings. As a remedy, a decision was made to transition into a q environment. However, as highlighted in the previous chapter, certain Python code proved challenging to migrate to q. Consequently, the team chose to remain within PyKX, this time operating within a q environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "pykx.q facilitates the execution of Python code within a q environment, thereby presenting new avenues for addressing existing codebases. This flexibility enables the incorporation and utilization of Python libraries, both those installed on the system and those available as .py files.\n",
    "\n",

    "Our initial step involves executing the `haversine_vector` function for calculating coordinate distances. Given its unavailability in q, we opted to employ pykx.q to seamlessly integrate this library directly into our q code. This was achieved through the following lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "```q\n",
    ".pykx.pyexec\"from haversine import haversine_vector, Unit\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function expects two Pandas DataFrames as input, so we need to change the default conversion type from \"np\" or Numpy to \"pd\" or Pandas:\n",

    "Ultimately, the project yielded remarkable success. We effectively transformed a previously disorganized and performance-constrained codebase into a streamlined, competitive solution, enriched by the capabilities of kdb+/q. PyKX's design is conducive to harmonious coexistence between more seasoned professionals and newcomers in the realm of kdb+/q development. This fosters collaborative synergy among team members with varying levels of expertise. The diverse integration levels of PyKX, combined with their compatibility, make it an accessible entry point to kdb+/q for less-experienced colleagues, thereby enhancing our team's collective skill set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pykx.q library allows, as we have discussed earlier, to use existing Python codebases. This feature is really useful, specially when dealing with code migrations from Python. Through our experience, we identified challenges in aligning Python input shapes with their counterparts converted from q. After using the `.pykx.set` function for conversion to Python, we often needed to manipulate these transformed objects within the Python environment or modify the default conversion type to match the expected input format of Python functions.. Once that was dealt with, the experience using this library was really nice and technically impressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the data we needed to transfer back and forth between memory spaces was not that big (we were cautious this was the case) we observed no perceptible loss in performance. Instead, we achieved a significant improvement compared to Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall we would rate both PyKX libraries highly since it enables users to reuse existing code, significantly reducing the time required for migrations between these two languages."
