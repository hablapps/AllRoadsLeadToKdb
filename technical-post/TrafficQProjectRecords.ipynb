    "# The Project <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"t1\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "A year ago, our team at the fictional company Mad Flow embarked on a new exiting project. Our primary objective was to create a real-time traffic forecasting system by leveraging heterogeneous data from smart-cities. Traffic analysis has become a vital component of smart cities, enabling enhanced road management and governance through improved traffic insights. \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the project's development, we encountered technical limitations that prevented us from solely relying on Pandas and plain Python. Our solution emerged through PyKX and Kdb+/q, a journey that's detailed in the post [All Roads Lead to Kdb](https://www.habla.dev/blog/2023/07/31/all-roads-lead-to-pykx.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this technical report, we will outline the process of migrating our code to the KX platforms. Before delving into the implementation details, we will first present the use case and the current status of our project. Then, we will talk about the q embedding on Python and vice versa and, since we did the migration twice (once to PyKX and again to pykx.q), the technical details of both implementations. By sharing our experiences with Kdb+/q and PyKX, we hope to shed light on the positive impact these tools have had on our endeavor.\n",

    "    \n",
    "In the project's initial phase, our objective was to prepare and ingest the data into an LSTM model. As is usual in projects associated with smart cities, the data is notably heterogeneous, demanding substantial preparatory efforts. Data on weather and traffic in the city of Madrid will be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although this project is novel in the city of Madrid, there are many articles that support it. For example, [F. Malik et al.](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/13/3749) forecasted traffic in Madrid based on air pollution through a model based on LSTM.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Regarding the weather and traffic correlation there are numerous studies, with a particular focus on rainfall.While none of these studies are conducted specifically in Madrid, they have been carried out in various major cities like Manchester ([A. Essien et al.](https://pure.manchester.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/72721911/DEXA_Camera_8_pages.pdf)), Shenzhen ([Y. Yao et al.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8964560)), Belgrade ([M. Vidas et al.](https://www.safetylit.org/citations/index.php?fuseaction=citations.viewdetails&citationIds[]=citjournalarticle_716898_14)). The results of these studies anticipate a weekday traffic volume increase of 5-15% during peak hours.\n",
    "    \n",
    "We found several blogs in [KX developer](https://kx.com/resources/developer-blog/)  related to the use of PyKX over Pandas, such as [A. Morrison](https://kx.com/blog/accelerating-python-workflows-using-pykx/) where he uses PyKX in the field of financial services. This article shows a big speed advantage of PyKX over Pandas.\n",

While direct measurement of this distance using coordinates is possible, we opted for the [Haversine distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) which calculates the distance in meters between a pair of coordinates, offering a clearer representation of distances.

    "To assess performance, we created a toy model using a simple LSTM with 5-step memory to predict the load at a specific traffic station. The input includes the precedings data of the load, the rainfall, the hour and day of the week. The results for a single station seem quite positive as can be seen in [Graph 6](#Image61). However, the computational expenses for an individual station and a single month data is unaffordable for the project budget. Furthermore, the preprocessing demands an excessive amount of time, rendering it impractical for real-time application.\n",

    "When the team got comfortable with the kdb/q language they started using almost entirely q code through `kx.q`, as it was more concise. But the programming became somewhat tedious having to use Strings. This is why it was decided to jump to a q environment. But as seen in the previous chapter, there was Python code that the team couldn't port to q. For this reason it was decided to stay in pykx but this time in the q environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "pykx.q allows Python code execution on a q environment and, as a result, it opens up the door for new opportunities when dealing with existing codebases as it allows for importing and using Python libraries, both installed on the system and available as .py files.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case we use both of these options. We will focus in this post on these opportunities to use Python code in pykx.q and leave the link to the project's [q script]() for the interested reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we want to execute the `haversine_vector` function to measure the distance between coordinates. Since it's not available on q, we decided to use pykx.q to incorporate this library straight into our q code with these lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "```q\n",
    ".pykx.pyexec\"from haversine import haversine_vector, Unit\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function expects two Pandas DataFrames as input, so we need to change the default conversion type from \"np\" or Numpy to \"pd\" or Pandas:\n",
    "\n",
    "```q\n",
    ".pykx.setdefault\"pd\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Having done this, we can \"move\" our input variables to the Python memory space using `.pykx.set`\n",
    "\n",
    "```q\n",
    ".pykx.set[`a;`longitude`latitude#a];\n",
    ".pykx.set[`b;`longitude`latitude#b];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally execute our function\n",
    "\n",
    "```q\n",
    "(.pykx.eval\"haversine_vector(a, b, Unit.KILOMETERS, comb=True)\")`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the backtick at the end, this is for converting back to a q type.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The other way we can run Python code is to load a .py (renamed to .p) file using `\\l`. This could be done as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```q\n",
    "system\"l kerasmodel.p\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have defined two functions named `fit` and `predict`. We can load them and use them like this:\n",

    "modelfit:.pykx.get`fit;\n",
    "modelfit[train[0][3403];train[1][3403];test[0][3403];test[1][3403]];\n",

    "Ultimately, the project was a resounding success. We succeeded in transforming a code characterized by disorganization and performance issues into a concise and competitive solution, empowered by Kdb+/q.\n",
    "PyKX has facilitated collaboration among a diverse team with varying levels of experience in Kdb+/q. This is thanks to the different levels of integration that PyKX has and their compatibility with each other. It has also provided a user-friendly introduction to Kdb+/q for less experienced team members. Moreover, the code was once again migrated, this time from the 'q' side to PyKX.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pykx.q library allows, as we have discussed earlier, to use existing Python codebases. This feature is really useful, specially when dealing with code migrations from Python. In our experience, we found specially tough to match the Python input shape to the one converted from q. After converting to Python with .pykx.set we often had to mess around with this transformed objects inside the Python environment or change the default conversion type to match it with the expected input the Python function needed. Once that was dealt with, the experience using this library was really nice and technically impressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the data we needed to transfer back and forth between memory spaces was not that big (we were cautious this was the case) we didn't notice a performance loss at all. Instead, we achieved a significant improvement compared to Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall we would rate both PyKX libraries highly since it enables users to reuse existing code, reducing the time needed to perform a migration from and to these two languages."
