    "# The Project <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"t1\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "One year ago we embark on a new project in Mad Flow. It continues the roadmap of the company to improve the quality of life in Madrid. The objective was to forecast the traffic in the city and to show it in an interface in real time so that citizens can better plan their route. Traffic analysis has become an indispensable task in smart cities. Having a better knowledge of the traffic allows a better organization and governance of the roads. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we studied the possibility of including other data such as precipitation or temperature  for better predictions. The data provided by sensors in smart cities are usually heterogeneous. In the case of the city of Madrid in Spain, there are climatic and traffic data that cover the entire center of the city but they were difficult to integrate and need a complex infrastucuture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing the model we found an important performance limitation. The infrastructure was slow and unwieldy when incorporating new traffic data-sets or building new insights quickly what is essential in the project. To move forward with the project, a change in implementation was necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "We found a solution to our problem: Kdb+/q by KX. This platform is extremely fast and flexible and allows data processing in real time. It also has PyKX, an open-source library that is designed to be friendly with Python programmers (essential in Mad Flow).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this technical report we present how the migration of the code to the KX platforms was carried out. But first we'll talk about the use case and the project status.\n",

    "The objective of the code is to prepare and join the traffic and weather data to be ingested by an LSTM model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this project is novel in the city of Madrid, there are many articles that support it. For example, [F. Malik et al.](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/13/3749) forecasted traffic in Madrid based on air pollution through a model based on LSTM.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the dependence of the weather on traffic there are many studies, especially focused on rainfall. None of the studies are carried out in Madrid, but in several large cities such as Manchester ([A. Essien et al.](https://pure.manchester.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/72721911/DEXA_Camera_8_pages.pdf)), Shenzhen ([Y. Yao et al.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8964560)), Belgrade ([M. Vidas et al.](https://www.safetylit.org/citations/index.php?fuseaction=citations.viewdetails&citationIds[]=citjournalarticle_716898_14)). The results of these studies predict a 5-15% increase in traffic volume on weekdays during peak hours."

This is why the measurements were divided into different classes depending on the level of rain and we did a separate analysis for the data with heavy rain, moderate to moderate and no rain. The analysis was done hourly to avoid the temporal dependence of the load.

    "When the team got comfortable with the kdb/q language they started using almost entirely q code through kx.q, as it was more concise. But the programming became somewhat tedious having to use Strings. This is why it was decided to jump to a q environment. But as seen in the previous chapter, there was Python code that the team couldn't port to q. For this reason it was decided to stay in pykx but this time in the q environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "pykx.q allows Python code execution on a q environment and, as a result, it opens up the door for new opportunities when dealing with existing codebases as it allows for importing and using Python libraries, both installed on the system and available as .py files.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case we use both of these options. We will focus in this post on these opportunities to use Python code in pykx.q and leave the link to the project's [q script]() for the interested reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we want to execute the `haversine_vector` function to measure the distance between coordinates. Since it's not available on q, we decided to use pykx.q to incorporate this library straight into our q code with these lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "```q\n",
    ".pykx.pyexec\"from haversine import haversine_vector, Unit\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function expects two Pandas DataFrames as input, so we need to change the default conversion type from \"np\" or Numpy to \"pd\" or Pandas:\n",
    "\n",
    "```q\n",
    ".pykx.setdefault\"pd\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Having done this, we can \"move\" our input variables to the Python memory space using `.pykx.set`\n",
    "\n",
    "```q\n",
    ".pykx.set[`a;`longitude`latitude#a];\n",
    ".pykx.set[`b;`longitude`latitude#b];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally execute our function\n",
    "\n",
    "```q\n",
    "(.pykx.eval\"haversine_vector(a, b, Unit.KILOMETERS, comb=True)\")`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the backtick at the end, this is for converting back to a q type.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The other way we can run Python code is to load a .py (renamed to .p) file using `\\l`. This could be done as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```q\n",
    "system\"l kerasmodel.p\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have defined two functions named `fit` and `predict`. We can load them and use them like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```q\n",
    "modelfit:.pykx.get`fit;\n",
    "modelfit[train[0][3403];train[1][3403];test[0][3403];test[1][3403]];\n",
